    I'm 22 years old, and I work remotely from my home as a freelance artist. I work mostly with graphic design and illustration with me learning 3D modelling on the side. Most of my graphic design work centres around logos and branding, yet I've been working with Game UI design as well thought that is still in it infancy. As far as Illustration are concern, they are Cartoon and Anime styled with most inspiration coming from music and stories I read. I want to get into Graphic Design and Illustration cause I love to create images that tell a story.
    
    I've used open source software for my artwork full time since 2010 and haven't regret it. Yet despite the difference in technical choice, I'm still able to present my work with the industry standards. Plus I can open any such files as well. The great thing about open source software is that I have a voice when it comes to the direction of software. Also I can branch off and customize it to suit my needs as well.
    
    Another great thing about open source software is the community that surrounds it. There is always someone willing to help me or mentor me, even if I make a mistake. Speaking of communities, I help maintain Jupiter Broadcasting's Google Plus Community, Jupiter Colony. They are a great bunch of people. I suggest you check it out as well.
    
    I hope to get along with some of you guys, and hopefully meet some of you as well.
