This Commission was a fun one. A few weeks ago I received an email of a person commissioning me to create a render version of her friend&#8217;s Amethyst Bonsai Tree as a Vector image. So I decided instead of drawing it with GIMP and then converting it to a vector image, I decided to do it all in Inkscape from the ground up. I have to say that has to be the best learning experience I&#8217;ve had with Inkscape. This was because I finally decided to use the Sculpture Tools and take advantage of the pressures sensitivity of my TabletPC.

I&#8217;m very pleased with how it came out and so was my client. Well if you have a art idea but need an artist to do, consider me. Well that all for now. Have a great day.^^
