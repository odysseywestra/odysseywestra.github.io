excerpt: |
  This is a speedpaint sketch part of digital Drawing fanart I did of Misaka Mikoto from "A Certian Scienific Railgun". This scene was inspired by the first episode of the second season where she was dropping down in the air about to launch her railgun ability at here unsuspecting victims. I wasn't able to record the rest due to the limitations of my TabletPC. But I have this uploaded so you can see how I drew on my drawing board. Well if you want to see the final, check out the link below. Well you guys have a great day and enjoy. ^^
