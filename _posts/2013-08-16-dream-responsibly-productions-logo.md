Alright, another logo commission is done. The logo is for Dream Responsibly Productions, it&#8217;s a visual production company deeply committed to social causes and to raising awareness of ways to improve the lives of others. Rather than dwell on the ills, the downsides, or the problems that affect children and adults, Dream Responsibly Productions focuses on the acts of kindness and concerns themselves with uplifting individuals and communities alike.

It was pretty interesting to work with them, for one I they asked me to make a couple of concepts before they would pay me the first half. I wouldn&#8217;t have had a problem, but they didn&#8217;t read my commission journal and try to pay me another way. I had to deal with them for three days before they paid me. I will not do that again.

Well anyway as far as I know, they liked the logo, and that all that matter to me. Yeah, it took longer for me to pay, because they wouldn&#8217;t communicate.
