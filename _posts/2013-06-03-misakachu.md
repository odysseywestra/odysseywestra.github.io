Okay well I did it, I was board one today, and said &#8220;Self I&#8217;m board, oh look at this&#8230;.let&#8217;s do this..&#8221; So here it is a full colored of Misaka from &#8220;A Certain Scientific Railgun&#8221; as Pikachu. It was a request from another fellow deviant artist, that really caught my interest to the point of drawing it. I though of using Misaka&#8217;s Hair Color for the tips of her hair, but didn&#8217;t looked good to me so I decided to keep her fur all yellow(with brown of course..^^&#8217;). Well here you Pokemon and Railgun fan go a cross character between the two anime has come. Well you guys enjoy and have a wonderful day.
