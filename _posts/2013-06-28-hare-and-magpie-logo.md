This is a Commission logo I did for a Soap shop call Magpie & Hare Naturals Inc. This has to have been one of the most challenging Commissions I&#8217;ve done so far. The hardest part of the commission was emulating the vintage style while still giving it that modern look and feel to it. Also the fun part was converting it over to a vector image. For this version(There were three), it had 49 layers that needed individually to be converted to a vector image, then downsizing it so it wouldn&#8217;t come out so big.

I&#8217;ve learned a lot when it comes to creating this kind of image, I have to say the most fun part about was coming up with the designs for the Magpie and the Hare, each had about 3-4 different concept designs and the end result is a combine version of those concepts. Surprisingly, all the inking was done in MyPaint with exception of the Wreath. The Wreath was an continuing pattern of three to four flower patterns drawn in MyPaint, then assembled to it&#8217;s full form in Gimp(Imagine trying to do that by hand. Believe me it hurts.^^&#8217;) I really love how MyPaint handles the brushes and inking. It make drawing digitally so fun. So despite the difficulty of the logo, this was the most fun and best learning experience I&#8217;ve had.

Well thank you owner of the Magpie & Hare Naturals Inc. for giving me a chance and being patient with me. This took three weeks to make and a lot of back and forth feedback. I take my commission seriously. Well like always I hope you guys are enjoying your day. Well take care!!^^
