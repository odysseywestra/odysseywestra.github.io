Another Commission done. Well anyways, this commission was from someone whom was refered from one of my first commissioners. He asked me to draw his character from an MMO called Champions Online which is a Comic Hero type game. He asked me to drawin the same pose as one of the Iron Man Promo Posters. So far the guy liked it but I haven&#8217;t heard from him since I finished it. Well anyways you guys enjoy and have a great day.^^
