Today is my little sister&#8217;s birthday. Why is this important? Cause she is a miracle.

On February 8, 2002, Zoe Westra was born at Bonner County General Hospital at 7:00 in the morning. We as a family would have never thought of what would happen that in a 1hr and 20min she was being helicoptered to Sacred Heart Medical Center Spokane WA. It was due to her to develop Cyonatic Hypoplastic Left Heart&#8217;s Syndrome or also known as &#8220;Blue Baby Syndrome&#8221;My Brother and I was up at five in the morning to see my parents off. They taken my little brother Matthew to my aunt and uncle&#8217;s place, and left my brother and I to get ready and go to school like any normal day. Later on that day, my aunt and uncle were going to pick us up, only to find out that something happen to my little sister and she had to be transported to another hospital. We stayed with them for a couple of weeks till my parents where able to pick us up, and take us to Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, WA(thats an hour or  drive away from where I lived).When we got there and after my mom and dad explain to us what happen, we got to see our baby little sister. It was funny to going through the the procedures to make sure we were clean, had to wear a mask, and a funny yellow colored scrubs before we go to see her. I was a little excited, yet also nervous cause she would be my first little sister to protect and be a mentor to (I&#8217;m the oldest of the four of us). As we came into the room with our HazMat like clothing and seeing other babies in similar situations as her, we saw my little sister Zoe. She was so tiny yet wired as well so that they can monitor her. She had surgery five days after she was born to help counteract against &#8220;Blue Baby Syndrome&#8221; at least till she was six months old for them to preform the actual surgery. I got to touch her at least, but not hold her till she was strong enough for it.We stayed at the Ronald McDonald House which was an half a mile away from the Sacred Heart for the next six months. I was home schooled at the time which really board me. I made a few friends there and we met with other families that had children in intensive care as well. It was an interesting experience living there.Over the next ten years she overcame these obstetrical(taken from my mom&#8217;s FB post).

1. TGA: Transposition of the Great Arteries

2. Cyonatic Hypoplastic Left Heart&#8217;s Syndrome- Congenital Heart  Disease. Also known as &#8220;Blue Baby Syndrome&#8221;. A Fontane procedure was  performed when you were 6 months old to redirect the upper Vena Cava  directly to the pulmonary arteries. This caused your blood circulation  to go straight to the lungs instead to the heart to be pumped to the  lungs. (ok, this is layman&#8217;s terms) The 2nd procedure was performed  April 18, 2006 when you were finally 30 pounds and redirected your lower Vena Cava also to the pulmonary area.

3. Respiratory Distress: The worst and hardest times were NOT the surgeries, but the respiratory swelling and building of fluids AFTER the surgeries.

4. HYPOCALCIMIA/Parathyroid complications: After you healed and made it  through surgeries, you started to have intense seizures. IT was the seizures that unnerved us the most because it took a long time to figure out what was wrong. After many tests and blood draws, we found out that your parathyroid wasn&#8217;t allowing your body to absorb calcium! Another  complication that was overcome. You literally had &#8220;sunshine in a bottle&#8221; as I learned how to give you Vitamin D to help your body absorb  calcium. The seizures were gone by summer.

5. REFLUX caused by GERD: We were to take you home in April. The night before you were to be discharged was when the nurses heard an alarm go off. They thought your leads (electronic sensors) came unhooked, but they found out that you  had spit up and it had went down your windpipe. It was then you had to  have your 2nd surgery to put in a G-tube; a Gastroenterology feeding  tube in because of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). You also had a surgery called a Nissan Fundoplication.

6. Hemi-vertebrae: literally a half-vertebrae formed in your spinal column. This is  something Shriner&#8217;s Hospital looks at once a year.

It amazing to see that fragile little girl to transform over ten years to a fun, loving, little, energetic munchkin that she is today. Even though I missed a few of those years, cause of bad choices I&#8217;ve made. I&#8217;m proud to say that Zoe is my little sister. Her name means life, and when she came into this world she sure did bring life into our lives. If you want a definition of a miracle, just look at her.
