<!--more-->It&#8217;s funny what you can do when your board. Yeah, I drew this last week in my sketch book. I&#8217;ve always love music(all sorts of music) so I decided to sketch something with a music theme. I wasn&#8217;t expecting much but once I started fleshing out the drawing, I liked it. So I looked up a few references of people holding headphone to their ears, and found a sheet music to base the Music Staff on. I did the lineart, shading and Highligting on MyPaint, but when it came to coloring, I decided to do the maincoloring effects with GIMP. This was mainly because I wanted to try out a G&#8217;MIC Plugin, plus I gotten my hands on my Brother&#8217;s Asus Gaming Laptop. I Also tried out something new by Coloring the Lineart as well which help it not look so dull. Now here it is, and it big enough to fit on a good size canvas. It took me a week, but I&#8217;m proud what came out of one board day. Alright, I should stop talking, Have a great day and enjoy..

Oh, by the way, Extra brownie points if you can tell me what music I used for my background.
