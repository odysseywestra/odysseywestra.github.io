After Three revisions(or was it four revisions&#8230;.I can&#8217;t remember&#8230;.>_<), and a month later, I finally have another illustration done. This one is base of another anime series I watched a couple years back. It&#8217;s call Anohana: The Flower we saw that day.

It&#8217;s about A group of six childhood friends drift apart after one of them, Meiko &#8220;Menma&#8221; Honma, dies in an accident. Ten years after the incident, the leader of the group, Jinta Yadomi, has withdrawn from society and lives as a recluse. One summer day, the ghost of an older looking Menma appears before him and asks to have a wish granted, reasoning that she cannot pass on into the afterlife until it is fulfilled. Since Menma does not remember what her wish is, Jinta gathers his estranged friends together once again, believing that they are the key to resolving this problem. However, hidden feelings, internal conflicts, and lingering feelings of bitterness from Menma&#8217;s parents result in complications for the group as they struggle to help not only Menma move on, but themselves as well.

Well This Illustration was a challenge. It took three or so revisions before I had it done right. I had to redo the poses who know how many times before I decided to settle with these ones. I do have a inked version, but after switching to a watercolor style coloring, it felt better to use the sketch instead. Another reason is that I redid the background as well so it can not feel so generic and was to lazy to want to re-ink it. ^^&#8217;

I did this all in MyPaint to illustrate how really powerful this program is for Digital Artists. What I found interesting about MyPaint, is that it ran better on my TabletPC, than gimp. This Drawing has 60+ layers, and ran like a champ under MyPaint, however If I loaded the same drawing in gimp, it would be a pain to work on or even edit. Granted, MyPaint, can&#8217;t do as much as Gimp, but it fulfills what I want: it lets me draw. Even though MyPaint releases a new version about a year between, but each release, it&#8217;s just gets better and better. Well check it out at www.paint.intilinux.com/

Well I hope you guys enjoy it, and you have a wonderful day. ^^
