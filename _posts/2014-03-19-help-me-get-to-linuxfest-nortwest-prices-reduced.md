Hey guy, I’m really looking forward to [Linux Fest Northwest](http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/){.external} this year cause it will be my first Linux convention ever. Plus I get to meet part of the [Jupiter Broadcasting](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com){.external} cast as well. Though money is getting tight mainly because I have to get my Driver License, and paying for various bill that have been long overdue. So in order for me to go to Linux Fest Northwest, I need your guy’s help.

I’ve been a long time Sonic the Hedgehog fan ever since my dad introduce me on his Sega Dreamcast years ago. Plus I love to draw those characters due to their whimsical cartoon style. When people see my drawing of my Sonic style Original Character, the first question I’m always asked is , “Can you draw me as a Sonic Character?”. Back then I always decline, because I was self-conscience on my style of work, and didn’t feel comfortable drawing them. However, now I want to take up that challenge.

So I&#8217;m opening commissions for pinup style Sonic Fan Characters. Whether it&#8217;s to turn you or your friends into one of them, or maybe flesh out the most awesome Sonic Fan Character that been itching your head, I can do it. So how much will it cost? Here is the rundown:

<del>$5/400 dA Points &#8211; Sketch version</del>

<del>$10/800$8/640 dA Points &#8211; Inking version</del>

<del>$15/1200 $10/800 dA Points  &#8211; Full base Coloring</del>

&nbsp;

The the work, from the sketch and up will be done on my Samsung Note Tablet with Artflow, and will be large enough to print on a standard 8” ½ x 11 paper at 300 dpi. Also if you purchase the Inking or Color versions, you&#8217;ll get the separate Ink and/or sketch version as well depending on which one you choose.

For payment, I will only use PayPal or dA points for payment. If you plan to pay with dA point, after we have an idea of what you are looking for use my Commission Widget to complete the transaction. The priority will be on a first come first serve bases. Once I get to you, I will contact you and ask for reference(s), description and payment upfront. I will do up to two characters per commission, however the price will be double. If you don’t respond to me in 24hr, I will have to move on to the next slot. If for some reason I am unable to finish your drawing, you will get a full-refund. Each drawing will take me up to 1 &#8211; 4 days to complete.

Okay to get a hold of me either leave a comment below on this journal and I’ll note you, or click on the commission widget on my dA profile to get started if you are paying with points. If your on Google, start an hangout chat with me. Or you can email me at **odysseywestra@gmail.com**

So to review:

1. Note, comment, hangout, or Email(****odysseywestra@gmail.com****) me letting me know your interested and I&#8217;ll put you down in a slot. Emailing me is the fastest.(First Come First Serve)

2. Once it&#8217;s your turn, I&#8217;ll get a hold of you via the way you contacted me. During that time, have your description of your character, and reference(s) ready. You have 24hrs to reply or else I&#8217;ll go to the next person in line.

3. Once we have an Idea of what you are looking for, Send me the required amount $5/$10/$15 via Paypal. If you plan on using dA Point, please use the Commission widget posted on my Deviantart Profile.

4. Once I receive payment, I&#8217;ll get to work on your commission. If for any reason I cannot complete your commission, or you change your mind before I finish, I will issue a full refund, no questions ask.

5. Time to completion of Commission will be 1-4 days. Once finished, I&#8217;ll send you a link so you may download it. You&#8217;ll be able to print it on a standard 8 ½&#8221; x 11&#8243; paper at 300 dpi if you wish.

Enjoy and share.

I&#8217;ll be accepting commission requests of this kind till **APRIL 23, 2014**, so get them while they are hot.

Alright, I hope you will enjoy this as much as I will, and Thank for those who has and will commission me. It really means a lot to me. Have a wonderful day!!

P.S. If you need help creating a description for you fancharacter, check out this document I scrape from a website a couple years ago at http://bit.ly/sonicfancharacter. I would have linked you guys to the original, but the original site is down, So I guess here&#8217;s the back up.

I&#8217;m also open for other commissions as well, just shoot me an email at **odysseywestra@gmail.com** and we&#8217;ll discuss business.
