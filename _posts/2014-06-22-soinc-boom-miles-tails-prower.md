  After Hearing of the new Sonic Boom games and TV series, I thought it would be fun to draw tails in his new gig. Out of all the characters, Tails has always been my favorite character due to not only his smarts, but also his determination to do his best despite what others may say.
</p>

Another reason for drawing this was to test out the latest Git version of MyPaint due to it 1.2 Version plans to come out in the coming months. I&#8217;v very excited for this release because it being ported to GTK3, adding support for group layers, and adding support for Layer Mask which I used in this one. If you need help getting a sandbox version to test out the latest version set up on Linux PM me.

Lastly, I&#8217;m providing the Source Files if you guys wish to see how I work and for examples on how the masks work which do not work like GIMP or Photoshop. Since it is a FanArt, this is only for personal use and cannot be used in any Commercial Setting.

Alright enough talking, here is the link to the source files &#8211;Â  <a href="http://sta.sh/0qrfuo980c6" target="_blank">http://sta.sh/0qrfuo980c6</a>

BTW this is the last time I&#8217;m using SketchUp in my Work Flow. After messing around with Blender, I realized I can do more with Blender than what I can do with SketchUp and I don&#8217;t have to worry about maintaining Wine for this one.

Alright you guys have a great day and Enjoy. ^^
