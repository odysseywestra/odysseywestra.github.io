Welp, it&#8217;s been awhile since I last submitted or drew anything lately. To be honest I&#8217;ve been pretty down for the past few months, but I&#8217;m slowly getting myself out of it. On the Bright side, MyPaint which was used to draw this has hit its version 1.2 beta cycle which means it almost ready for release. Right now it&#8217;s in need of translators to localize all the strings so if you want to help, go to https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/ to get started. Well I hope you guys have a great day, and I hope to have another illustration out real soon. ^^
