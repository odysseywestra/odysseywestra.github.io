Whewwww&#8230;&#8230;. <img title="Phew!" src="http://i2.wp.com/e.deviantart.net/emoticons/w/whew.gif?resize=25%2C17" alt=":phew:" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="486" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Well anyways&#8230;..This is the project <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u premium username" href="http://chibi-jen-hen.deviantart.com">chibi-jen-hen</a></span> set up as the Secret Santa Project where a bunch of artist got to be a santa and drew a piece of artwork for another artist which <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u premium username" href="http://chibi-jen-hen.deviantart.com">chibi-jen-hen</a></span> set up and arrange. So a few days after signing up for it I got a note from <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u premium username" href="http://chibi-jen-hen.deviantart.com">chibi-jen-hen</a></span> which said this&#8230;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Hello!</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Thanks for joining my Secret Santa! Sorry this took so long, but please note some changes: I&#8217;ve changed the due date of the art to January 15th. You cannot submit your art later than that. You can submit work anytime between now and then.</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>So with that said, the artist you will be drawing for is: <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="http://tessaiyasongbird.deviantart.com">Tessaiyasongbird</a></span></em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>And here is their note of what they requested:</em><br /> <em> &#8220;heres what i want someone to do, to draw my chara and her boyfriend blade in a romantic seen together!&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Remember you can&#8217;t tell you&#8217;re Secret Santa you have them! If you have questions ask me and I&#8217;ll get in touch with them.</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Have fun!</em>
</p>

Okay, So it not exactly a romantic Scene, but I though since it winter(In my area at least, no snow though&#8230;.) it would be nice to draw them together ice-skating. The background did had a lineart to it but once I finished coloring it, I hid it to see how it turns out and sure enough I like it better without the lineart. With the characters, I&#8217;m sorry if I made any error to your characters, I know I did with Tessaiya Gloves, and goggles(if they are goggles) it was a bit hard to get an idea of how to draw her, but I did have fun drawing her don&#8217;t get me wrong. So here you are <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="http://tessaiyasongbird.deviantart.com">Tessaiyasongbird</a></span>, I hope you really like this, and I hope you had a wonderful Christmas. Now on to the next project.
