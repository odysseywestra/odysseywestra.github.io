<!--more-->Well I intended to finish and uploaded this yesterday, but by the time I finished this at 11:00 PST I didn&#8217;t have enough time to upload it to Deviantart. I actually had fun drawing this mainly because this the first full blown illustration that I&#8217;ve done with with MyPaint completely, except using the gimp for image manipulation(Hey, MyPaint is not made to do that). Well besides all the lateness, I wish you guys all had a wonderful Christmas, I got a $20 Gift Card for Fred Myers and Went over the next day with a few Friends to buy some things(mainly games&#8230;What can I say, I&#8217;m a guy. -_^&#8217;) Well Like I said earlier I hope you guys had a Wonderful Christmas I hope my next one will be on time for New Years.
